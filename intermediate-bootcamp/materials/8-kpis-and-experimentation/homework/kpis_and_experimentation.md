# Week 6 – Product Experimentation: Spotify

## User Journey

### First Experience
When I first started using Spotify, I was impressed by:
- **Simple onboarding** – logging in via Google or Facebook was quick.
- **Personalized recommendations** right after selecting a few artists I liked.
- **Clean, intuitive interface** that made it easy to find songs, albums, and playlists.

### Overall Impression
Spotify evolved from a simple streaming app to a **daily companion** that understands my taste, helps me focus at work, and makes commuting more enjoyable.

## Experiments to Improve the Experience

### **Experiment 1: Smart Mood-Based Playlists**

**Idea:**  
Introduce an AI-powered playlist that adapts to the user's **current mood or activity** (using listening patterns, tempo preference, and optional user input).

#### **Test Cells:**
| Test Group | Description |
|-------------|--------------|
| Control | Regular playlists + existing recommendations |
| Variant A | Mood-based playlists (user selects mood manually) |
| Variant B | Mood-based playlists (AI detects mood automatically) |

#### **Metrics:**
- **Leading:** Playlist start rate, skip rate per session  
- **Lagging:** Daily active users (DAU), listening time per user, retention rate  

**Hypothesis:**  
AI-curated mood playlists will **increase engagement and session duration** compared to static recommendations.

### **Experiment 2: Collaborative Playlist Chat Feature**

**Idea:**  
Allow users collaborating on a playlist to **chat directly inside the playlist**, react to songs, or suggest new ones.

#### **Test Cells:**
| Test Group | Description |
|-------------|--------------|
| Control | Standard collaborative playlist (no chat) |
| Variant A | Playlist chat enabled |
| Variant B | Playlist chat + emoji reactions |

#### **Metrics:**
- **Leading:** Number of interactions per playlist, songs added per user  
- **Lagging:** Retention rate of collaborative playlists, number of new shared playlists created  

**Hypothesis:**  
Adding social interaction to collaborative playlists will **increase playlist creation and sharing frequency**, enhancing community engagement.

### **Experiment 3: Personalized Audio Summaries**

**Idea:**  
Offer users a short **audio summary** narrated by Spotify AI (e.g., “This week you listened to more jazz than usual!”).

#### **Test Cells:**
| Test Group | Description |
|-------------|--------------|
| Control | No summaries |
| Variant A | Text summary in-app |
| Variant B | Audio summary with voice narration |

#### **Metrics:**
- **Leading:** Click-through rate to summaries, share rate of summary content  
- **Lagging:** Retention, subscription upgrades (to Premium), social engagement  

**Hypothesis:**  
Audio summaries will **increase user connection and sharing behavior**, driving higher retention and word-of-mouth growth.
